/// AE#792: replacing a live session's request headers without a rebuild.
///
/// A media server that requires a bearer token on every request, with tokens that live an hour,
/// rotates the credential under any long title. Nothing about the session changes when it does:
/// the source, the routing and the byte stream are the same, and only the value of one header is
/// new. `reloadAtCurrentPosition(applying:)` (#460) can install it, but it is a teardown at the
/// playhead, a visible restart bought for a value only the NEXT request reads.
///
/// Every request an `AVIOReader` builds goes through `headers(for:)`, so the only thing that kept a
/// session on its load-time headers was that each reader froze a copy at its open. The session now
/// creates one `RequestHeaderStore` per load and hands it to every reader it opens on its source
/// (the playback demuxer, the producer's reopens and revives, the I-frame and subtitle side
/// readers); this call replaces the value in it.

    /// The set REPLACES the current one, the way `LoadOptions.httpHeaders` does at `load`; it is not
    /// merged. It is also installed into the session's options, so every rebuild that replays them
    /// (an audio switch, a background return, `reloadAtCurrentPosition()`) opens with it too.
    ///
    /// A request already in flight finishes with the headers it was sent with. A reconnect that is
    /// backing off after a refusal sends the new set on its next attempt, so a session stalled over
    /// a lapsed credential heals without a teardown once the host supplies a current one.
