/// other byte comes from the representation file that holds it, through one seekable reader per
/// representation and a small block cache in front of each.
///
/// The cache is what keeps the request count at what a DASH player would spend. libavformat reads
/// an interleaved file sample by sample in decode order, which in this layout alternates between a
/// video fragment and the audio fragments next to it, and every switch is an AVIO seek and a fresh
/// buffer fill. A ranged reader with one window answers each return to the video fragment with a new
/// request a few kilobytes behind the last one (measured: 1042 requests for 45 s of one video file).
/// With the last few blocks of each file kept, those returns are memory reads, and each file is
/// fetched forward once, in requests that grow the way they do for any single file.
///
/// The moofs are rewritten on the way out (`DASHFragmentPatcher`). Their positions are only known
/// once read, so each piece is scanned box by box up to the end of whatever range is being read,
/// through the same cache and just ahead of the bytes the read is about to return anyway.
