/// `panelRefusedHDRMaster` records that AVFoundation refused an HDR master, which is a fact about an
/// output CONFIGURATION rather than about the panel. The user changes that configuration in Settings,
/// the platform reports nothing when they do, and an Apple TV can hold the same app process for days,
/// so a latch taken in a mode that genuinely refused kept routing every HDR title media-direct long
/// after the mode was changed back. Measured by classicjazz on #459: two boxes with identical panel
/// readouts, one serving the master and one not, and a force-quit curing the second one.
///
/// Reaching the output format means leaving the app, so a real return from the background is the one
/// event guaranteed to follow the change. The latch is forgotten there and re-earned, at the price of
/// one in-place media fallback, by the next HDR load that is still refused.
